                Sri Lankan cuisine is one of the most complex cuisines in South Asia. It has been very strongly influenced by the cuisine of South India due to its proximity to Sri Lanka, but also by other cuisines that have in the past been a major commercial crossroads for the colonial powers.
                Despite its strong links with that of southern India, Sri Lankan cuisine is distinguished by the delicacy and lightness of its flavors, for the intensive but balanced use of coconut milk and its tasty and colorful tropical fruits and plants.
                And here are some of our feavourit recipes from Sri Lankan cuisine !
